Describing my influences

My parents are my influences because they tell me most things before I hear about them else where so I believe them more than other people they also tell me things like I should be christian and so I will be christian when I'm young and will probably be christian then I am older as well. I also read the newspaper First News every week because I have a subscription and I get lots of news from there before I hear it elsewhere and so will be more likely to believe the paper. My older brother is also an influence to me because I would like to be like him when Iâ€™m older and so I am inclined to do things a bit like him.
