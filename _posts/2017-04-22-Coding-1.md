    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>There wasn’t really a target this lesson as not all the software was working so we had to do something different.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td> I learned some things you can do to try and convert a PDF into a document but I'm not sure whether they worked as the software wasn’t working properly so we had to do some levels on lightbot. ( for homework we had to complete it and here in my completion certificate:)</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was to immersed in my work and I got stuck on a level that my teacher was doing on the board and i didn’t notice.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be aware of what my teacher is doing so I have more time for other things in the lesson.</td>
