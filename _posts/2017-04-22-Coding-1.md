  <tr>
    <td> I learned some things you can do to try and convert a PDF into a document but I'm not sure whether they worked as the software wasn’t working properly so we had to do some levels on lightbot. ( for homework we had to complete it and here in my completion certificate:)</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>

    <td>I was to immersed in my work and I got stuck on a level that my teacher was doing on the board and i didn’t notice.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be aware of what my teacher is doing so I have more time for other things in the lesson.</td>
