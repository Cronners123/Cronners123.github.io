  <tr>
    <td>Activity:  What are you going to be doing this lesson? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I am going to fix the high-score because at the moment it doesn't reset when you beat it. Also I am going to edit my instructions page because it doesn’t say about the endless mode at the end of my game.</td>
