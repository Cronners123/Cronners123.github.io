    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I learned that my game was too hard but needed to be more intense. I also learned that my game needed an aim and better instructions it also needed a smaller scoreboard. At the end of the lesson I learned how to save my game well.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>I was a bit slow at reviewing the games and instead of doing 2 reviews I did 3.</td>
