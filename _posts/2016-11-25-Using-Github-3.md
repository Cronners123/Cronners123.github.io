  <tr>
    <td>I learned how to make a table in HTML code and then how to add table headers into a table. Here is the code:
<html>
<table>
   <tr>
       <th> Insert text here.</th>
       <td> Insert text here.</td>
   </tr>
</table>
</html></td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>

    <td>I think memory limited my learning a bit as I forgot my password. I also wanted to add a video onto my website but i didn't have the code to do that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will ask for help with code I donâ€™t know and want to learn. I will also try to challenge myself.</td>
  </tr>
