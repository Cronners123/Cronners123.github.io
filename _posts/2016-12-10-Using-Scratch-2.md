    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started looking at bad guys and powerups in scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The target was to make to working bad guys for our maze game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I think I achieved my target as I made one bad guy that moved randomly and one that moved from side to side. </td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned how to make my character bounce off the walls instead of going back to the beginning and stopped a glitch of him going through the wall.. I also learned how to make one of the bad guys move randomly around the maze. I also learned how to make power ups.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I wanted to make my character to move properly before I made the bad guys and so that took longer that I had expected because there was a little problem in the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will work on the task that has been set and then with the extra time I will make the rest of the game work.</td>
