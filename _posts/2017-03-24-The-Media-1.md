The Media 1

Today we were analyzing this advert:

It is about 3 big hamsters who go for a workout at a gym and then you see a man designing a car then it flips back to the hamsters for a couple of seconds and then back to the car designer. Then it flips to one of the hamsters who is swimming and then to the designer who is in his car. Next it flips back to the hamsters who are doing harder workouts and are then in the hairdressers. Last you see a car going to a red carpet event and then the hamsters get out looking completely different and they start having a good time. We made a lot of inferences from this video. Then we saw a video about what some people did on a photo shoot to make the picture look better and then we had a disscussion about that.
